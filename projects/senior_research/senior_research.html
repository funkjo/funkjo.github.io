    <p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify; padding-left: 4in; padding-right: 4in;">A common feature on many websites is a way to catch bots and automated scripts and prevent them from logging into accounts or making new accounts. These features are called CAPTCHAs. Prior research has shown that machine learning models are capable of learning how to classify images from a dataset used by image selection CAPTCHAs. In this research, I propose a convolutional neural network that can classify images from a dataset of traffic themed CAPTCHA images with an accuracy of 83%. The results from this research show that images with obstructions, small or distant target classes, or multiple target classes are difficult for the model to classify, proving my hypothesis. These types of images should represent the majority of images in a CAPTCHAs dataset in order to improve its security and robustness. </p>
