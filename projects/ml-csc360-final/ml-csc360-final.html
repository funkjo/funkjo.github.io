    <br/>
    <p class="w3-opacity"><i>Abstract</i></p>
    <p class="w3-justify">The objective of this project is to present an overview of the machine learning techniques and concepts learned throughout the course in order to find the best machine learning model that can efficiently predict employee attrition in the IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition and Performance dataset. Employees leaving a company leads to significant costs for a business, including the cost of business disruption, hiring new staff, and training new staff. The ability to predict if an employee will leave a company is very important because it could save time and money. Some of the core concepts learned during this course that were applied to this data set were exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, model selection, and model evaluation. Using Python and the Python package matplotlib, we explored the dataset in order to understand its features and how they relate to each other. NumPy and Pandas were used during the data preprocessing stage. Finally, using the preprocessed dataset and the Python package Scikit-Learn, different models learned throughout the course such as KNN, decision tree, SVM, logistic regression, artificial neural networks, random forest classifier, and other boosting models, were used to predict employee attrition. Results show that the artificial neural network model, a multi-layer perceptron classifier, was the most accurate at predicting employee attrition, having an accuracy of 100% on unseen data, and the logistic regression model was the worst with an accuracy of 77.8% on unseen data.</p>
